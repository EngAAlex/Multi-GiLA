/**
 * This class contains the code for the connected components discovery.
 * 
 *  It has been slightly modified to adapt to Dafne's framework but it has been left untouched for the most part. 
 *  
 *  What follows is the description taken from the original class.
 * 
 * ##################################################################
 * 
 * Implementation of the HCC algorithm that identifies connected components and
 * assigns each vertex its "component identifier" (the smallest vertex id
 * in the component)
 *
 * The idea behind the algorithm is very simple: propagate the smallest
 * vertex id along the edges to all vertices of a connected component. The
 * number of supersteps necessary is equal to the length of the maximum
 * diameter of all components + 1
 *
 * The original Hadoop-based variant of this algorithm was proposed by Kang,
 * Charalampos, Tsourakakis and Faloutsos in
 * "PEGASUS: Mining Peta-Scale Graphs", 2010
 *
 * http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ukang/papers/PegasusKAIS.pdf
